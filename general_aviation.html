      <h2>General Aviation</h2>

        I grew up around airplanes.  My grandad is a private pilot, so I became
        very comfortable around planes at a young age.  We made many trips to
        Florida and Texas to see family in his plane.

        I started my pilot's license when I was 15 years old.  I actually did
        my first solo flight on my 16th birthday, the youngest legal age, and I
        took my pilot's test on my 17th birthday, again the youngest legal age.
        Sadly, after that, time and finances got a little tight, and my flying
        slowed for several years, until a couple years ago when I was able to
        get active again.

        The picture above is from a flight I made with the family for the
        famous $100 hamburger a couple years ago.  I am currently working on my
        instrument rating and hope to have it completed some time in 2016!
