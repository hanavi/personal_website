      <h2>Astronomy</h2>

      <div class='hobbies-text'>
        I have always been interested in astronomy.  When I was a kid, I used to
        go out with a small telescope and spend all night looking through it at
        random planets and stars without really knowing what I was doing.  While
        attending UAH, a few friends and I decided to start an astronomy club.
        During this time, I learned a ton about amateur astronomy as the vice
        president and eventually president of the UAH Astronomy Club. At the same
        time, I was studying astrophysics in my classes and preparing to start my
        PhD in astrophysics at Georgia Tech. The picture below is from one of our
        meetings where we  had a huge turn out to observe a passing comet.

        In grad school, I attended a summer school to learn more about analyses
        using the data from the Fermi Space Telescope.  During that time, there
        was a transit of Venus across the Sun where I used my experience from the
        UAH Astronomy Club to help others observe the transit.

        Astronomy remains an inspirational force in my life.  I still love going
        out at setting up my telescope and observing various galaxies, nebulae,
        and planets.  One future goal I have is observe all of the Messier
        Objects.
