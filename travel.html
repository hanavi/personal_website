      <h2>My Travel</h2>

      <div class='hobbies-text'>
        I love to travel, and I have been very fortunate to have some interesting
        trips!  I have been to Europe several times and visited many countries
        including Switzerland, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, The Netherlands, and
        England.  I have also been to Israel, Guatemala, and I was also able to
        visit Rio de Jainero for a conference a couple years ago.

        The most interesting trip I have been able to make was to the South Pole
        for some calibration work on the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.  I have
        posted links to some of my travel albums below.
