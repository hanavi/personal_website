      <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>

      <div class='hobbies-text'>
        I started diving several years ago.  The picture below is from my final
        training dive.  I worked through a handful of diving certifications
        through SDI including rescue diver before I started grad school.  All my
        diving has been at local rock quarries, but I am looking forward to
        actually getting out into the ocean one of these days with all the sea
        life.

        Diving is one of my many hobbies that took a back seat to grad school so
        I am hoping to get back out and do some more diving this summer!
