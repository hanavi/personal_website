      <h3>Music</h3>

      <div class='hobbies-text'>
        Music has always been a very important part of our family.  I play
        trumpet, guitar, and violin; though, the past few years I haven't had the
        time to focus on it like music as much as I would like.  I started
        playing trumpet in middle school and played for several years.  In high
        school, I started playing a little guitar as well, but I really only play
        a little here and there.

        Our family wall of guitars.  We actually have way more than this, but
        there was only so much wall space in my mom's music room!  I started
        playing violin a couple of years ago in grad school.  The picture below
        is from the music room at the South Pole, where I was able to jump on a
        violin for a few minutes!
