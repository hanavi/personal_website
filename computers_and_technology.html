        <p>
          I am somewhat passionate about technology.  I have been a Linux user
          for over 10 years.  My first Linux system was a version of SuSE I
          actually bought at a major retailer in town.  After that I spent many
          years working on Slackware and have most recently settled into
          running Ubuntu.  I have many VMs I run on my server that I use for
          random projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I worked as a network administrator for over 6 years where I worked
          with many different forms of computer and network technology in an
          environment where I had some freedom to experiment.  I have built and
          broken more systems than I could count!  I was even responsible for
          our phone system at the time where I learned about and experimented
          with Asterisk.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past several years I have  explored several programming
          languages including Python, C/C++, Java, PHP, and MySQL.  In my free
          time I sometimes work on problems from Project Euler.
