      I am a scientist currently living in Alabama after finishing an
      amazing year living and working at the geographic South Pole in
      Antarctica.

      <p>
      After over a year on the Ice, I was very fortunate to be able to travel
      and visit several countries as I "traveled my way home." I have now been
      to all seven continents, but I am to be back home and working on a long
      term career somewhere not quite so cold!
      </p>

      <p>
      I have many interests and hobbies, including travel, technology, Linux,
      python, Music, general aviation, and various other things I like to work
      on as time permits.
